This is a mysql database application, designed to act as an online store.  Upon activation, the program will first display a listing of the fictional items for sale in the mysql database.  It will display information such as the name of the item, the price, the number of items still in stock, and the item ID number.

Then, it will ask the users to enter the ID number of the item they wish to purchase.  Once this is entered, it will then ask the user to enter the exact quantity of the particular item they wish to purchase.  If there is not enough of an item in stock, an error message will display.  Otherwise, the program will congratulate the user on their purchase and display the total cost in dollars.
